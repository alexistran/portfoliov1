				    <p id="overview-header">OVERVIEW<p>
				    <p id="overview">In Spring 2016, I participated in and won first place in the Berkeley Builds hackathon. Each team was partnered up with a non-profit organization and my team was partnered up with BAWAR (Bay Area Women Against Rape). We decided to create a messaging app that would allow victims to reach out to counselors anonymously online to get the help that they need. <br><br>I played a role in coding the backend and front end of the web application (HTML, CSS, Meteor.js). Due to the limited time (2 days) and my focus on learning a new framework, I didn't have time to think about the design. Once I learned more about design and design thinking, I wanted to take on the challenge of redesigning this application as I saw potential for improvement. <br><br>The original hackathon project is viewable <a href="http://bawarchat.herokuapp.com/" class="link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>

			  		<p><b>How do I make it easier for people who have undergone sexual violence to have access to help?</b></p>
			  		<p>This was the problem space my team was given. During the hackathon my team came up with the idea of creating a messaging app that people would be able to access through the BAWAR site, that would allow them to anonymously talk to a counselor. There is a hotline that exists, but it might not be easy to verbalize what has happened to you. It's also not as discreet to talk to someone to get help, if you live in a shared place where you can get overheard.​​​​​​​<br><br></p>

			  		<p id="header">DESIGN DECISIONS</p>
			  		<p>After conducting research, I came up with ideas I wanted to incorporate into the redesign:</p>
			  		<ul>
			  			<li>No login/sign up page to maintain anonymity and a message that reaffirms that the user is safe (the original design had a lot of wasted screen space and the user had to click on a separate link to sign in)</li>
			  			<li>An "escape button" that would allow the user to go to a different site, such as google, in case the user needs to quickly hide the messages</li>
			  			<li>Ambiguous chat UI so that people from a distance can't tell what the user is doing</li>
			  			<li>Minimalistic design that focuses the user on the main issue at hand</li>

							<p id="header">TAKEAWAYS</p>
							<p>There are a lot of ways to approach this problem, and while I wanted to make something “pretty”, I decided to keep the design very minimalistic, to not distract from the main issue. From our previous design I found the login/signup aspect to be a deterrent in people being able to talk to counselors. Signing up for an account is a fairly permanent thing for a topic most people would not like to remember. I eliminated the entire sign up process so that people can just talk directly to counselors to get help, removing a barrier. The counselor should be able to sign in through a secret access point, in order to not put anyone at risk. <br><br>From the user feedback I collected on the mid-fidelity prototype, I was able to iterate on the design to further clarify certain features I didn't realize had flaws before.<br><br>If I had more time, I would like to conduct further user testing with people who would use this application. </p>
