	    				<p class="about-subsubtitle">TLDR: I'm a software engineer that decided to jump ship and pursue design, my true passion.</p>
	    				<p>I grew up dabbling in everything art related (everything from painting to theater). I got my first taste of digital design when I was in elementary school playing a virtual pet game called <a href="https://www.neopets.com/" class="highlight" target="_blank">Neopets</a>. I created banners and guild site designs, and dabbled in html and css. Growing up, my parents also taught me the importance of being considerate, thoughtful, and aware of other people. <br><br>My creative and empathetic upbringing built the foundation for my interest in a career I didn't know existed until fairly late in college. By the time I found out that digital design went beyond graphic design, and that there were other facets that aligned completely with me, I was already deeply down a software engineering path. I took on a SWE internship at Blizzard Entertainment where I had a mentor that helped me explore other career paths, and I got to experience being a designer in an industry setting, and implementing design thinking into my projects that began with me solely focused on code implementation. <br><br>From there, I was terrified, but I decided to jump ship and pivot. I want to bring along all the experiences and things I've learned with my non-traditional background into design with me. </p>
